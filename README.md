 This code implements a Streamlit application for text classification using the pre-trained BERT model bert-base-uncased. It allows users to enter text and receive 
 predictions about its category (sports or technology).

 ## Features:

 - Leverages the powerful BERT model for accurate text classification.
 - Streamlit-based interface for ease of use and interactivity.
 - Clear predictions with category labels.

## Requirements:

 - Python 3.x
 - Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
 - Transformers (pip install transformers)
 - PyTorch (pip install torch)

## Usage:

 - Open the app in your web browser (usually http://localhost:8501).
 - Enter a text in the text area.
 - Click the "Classify Text" button.
The predicted category (sports or technology) will be displayed.
